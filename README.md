## About the Project

This is a step-by-step project tutorial on how to scrape the Amazon Bestsellers Fashion page using Python , Beautifulsoup and Selenium. This project is a part of my portfolio to showcase my skills in web scraping and data extraction.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

1. Python installed on your system.
2. pip (Python package manager) installed.
3. Chrome browser and driver installed.


#### URL to be scraped is - [https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/fashion/ref=zg-bs_fashion_dw_sml ](https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/fashion/ref=zg-bs_fashion_dw_sml)

## Step 1: Install Selenium

To get started, we need to install the Selenium library. Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

```bash
pip install selenium
```

## Step 2: Import Necessary Libraries

Create a Python script or Jupyter Notebook for your project and import the necessary libraries at the beginning of your script:

```python
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait
from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
```

These libraries will help us automate web scraping and parse HTML content.

## Step 3: Set Up Chrome Driver

We will use Selenium with a Chrome driver. Set up the Chrome driver in headless mode (i.e., without opening a visible browser window):

```python
options = webdriver.ChromeOptions()
options.add_argument('--headless')
driver = webdriver.Chrome(options=options)
```

This configuration allows us to run the scraping process silently.

## Step 4: Define the URL

Now, let's define the URL of the Amazon Bestsellers Fashion page we want to scrape:

```python
url = "https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/fashion/ref=zg-bs_fashion_dw_sml"
```

## Step 5: Navigate to the URL

Navigate to the URL using the Chrome driver and wait for the page to load:

```python
driver.get(url)
wait = WebDriverWait(driver, 10)
wait.until(EC.presence_of_element_located((By.CLASS_NAME, "p13n-desktop-grid")))
```

We are waiting for the element with the class name "p13n-desktop-grid" to ensure that the page has loaded before proceeding.

## Step 6: Find the Product Column

Next, we find the product column on the page using its class name:

```python
product_column = driver.find_element(By.CLASS_NAME, "p13n-desktop-grid")
```

## Step 7: Parse HTML Content

Parse the HTML content of the product column using BeautifulSoup:

```python
soup = BeautifulSoup(product_column.get_attribute('innerHTML'), 'html.parser')
```

## Step 8: Extract Product Details

Now, let's find all the product items on the page and extract their details:

```python
products = soup.find_all('div', class_='a-cardui _cDEzb_grid-cell_1uMOS expandableGrid p13n-grid-content')
for product in products:
    # Extract product name
    name = product.find('div', {'class': '_cDEzb_p13n-sc-css-line-clamp-3_g3dy1'}).text.strip()

    # Extract product review
    review = product.find('span', {'class':  'a-icon-alt'}).text.strip()

    # Extract product price
    price = product.find('span', {'class': '_cDEzb_p13n-sc-price_3mJ9Z'})
    if price is not None:
        price = price.text
    else:
        price = 'N/A'

    # Extract product link
    link = product.find('a', {'class': 'a-link-normal'})['href']

    print(f'Title: {name}')
    print(f'Review: {review}')
    print(f'Price: {price}')
    print(f'Product Link : https://www.amazon.com{link}')
    print("")
```

This code snippet extracts product names, reviews, prices, and links for each product and prints them to the console.

## Step 9: Run the Script

Save your Python script and run it. You should see the scraped product details
